Preamble

This document outlines a practical exercise related to System Administration, specifically focusing on networking.
Introduction

This project is a hands-on exercise aimed at discovering networking concepts. You will configure small-scale networks using a web-based training interface, which provides a series of 10 exercises to complete.
General Guidelines

    You will need to understand TCP/IP addressing to configure the networks.
    Complete 10 levels of exercises and submit them via your Git repository.
    The networks are simulated and accessed through a training interface in your web browser.

Mandatory Part

    Download and Setup:
        Download the attached file from the projectâ€™s page.
        Extract the files into any folder.
        Run the index.html file to open the training interface in your web browser.

    Using the Interface:
        Welcome to NetPractice! :)
        You can practice by entering your login in the provided field or use the correction version by leaving the field empty.
        Each level presents a non-functioning network diagram with a goal to achieve.
        Use the Check again button to verify your configuration.
        Use the Get my config button to download your configuration for submission.
        Upon successfully completing a level, a button will appear to proceed to the next level.

    Exporting Configurations:
        Before moving to the next level, export your configuration using the Get my config button and save it to your Git repository.

    Example Exercise:
        Modify the unshaded fields in the network diagram until the configuration is correct.
        Understanding TCP/IP addressing is crucial for success.

Submission and Peer-Evaluation

    Submit your assignment in your Git repository. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense.
    Ensure all file names are correct.
    Submit 10 files (one for each level) at the root of your repository.
    During the defense, you will be required to complete 3 random levels within a limited time.
    External tools are not allowed during the evaluation, except for a simple calculator like "bc".
